## rateLimit
The `rateLimit` function is used to determine whether a request should be rate limited or not. 
It is easily configured to have a custom rate limit based on the API key. 

### RateLimitConfigOptions
This is the interface that allows you to configure the rate limit.


```ts
/**
 * RateLimitConfigOptions interface defines the configuration options for rate limiting.
 */
export interface RateLimitConfigOptions {
  /**
   * The maximum number of requests allowed within a specified window of time.
   * Default: 5 requests per second if not specified.
   */
  limit?: number;

  /**
   * The length of the time window in seconds during which the requests are counted.
   * Default: 1 second if not specified.
   */
  window?: number;
}
```

### Example


```ts
// 10 requests per second
const rateLimited = await client.rateLimit({
  limit: 10,
  window: 1,
});
```
